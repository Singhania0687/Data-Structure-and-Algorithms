### **What is a Pure Virtual Function?**

A **pure virtual function** in C++ is a function that has no implementation in the base class and must be overridden by derived classes. It is declared by assigning `= 0` in its declaration.

### **Syntax**

```cpp
class Base {
public:
    virtual void display() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};
```

1. **`= 0`**: This makes the function "pure," indicating that the base class does not provide any definition for it.
2. **Abstract Class**: A class containing at least one pure virtual function becomes an **abstract class** and cannot be instantiated.

---

### **Purpose of Pure Virtual Functions**
1. **Defining Interfaces**:
   - Pure virtual functions allow the creation of a class interface that derived classes must adhere to.
   - The base class serves as a blueprint, and the derived classes must provide specific implementations.
   
2. **Enforcing Overriding**:
   - Derived classes are forced to override pure virtual functions to provide their behavior.

3. **Achieving Polymorphism**:
   - They are a key tool for enabling polymorphism, particularly in large-scale systems where base classes define common operations for a family of objects.

---

### **How Pure Virtual Functions Work**

- When the compiler encounters a pure virtual function in a class, it:
  - Marks the class as **abstract**.
  - Ensures that objects of the abstract class cannot be created directly.
  - Requires derived classes to implement the pure virtual functions.

- If a derived class does not implement all pure virtual functions of its base class, it also becomes abstract and cannot be instantiated.

### **Example: Pure Virtual Functions**

#### **Example 1: Shape Hierarchy**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Shape {
public:
    virtual void draw() = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual double area() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class Circle : public Shape {
private:
    double radius;

public:
    Circle(double r) : radius(r) {}

    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Circle" << endl;
    }

    double area() override {
        return 3.14159 * radius * radius;
    }
};

class Rectangle : public Shape {
private:
    double length, width;

public:
    Rectangle(double l, double w) : length(l), width(w) {}

    void draw() override {
        cout << "Drawing Rectangle" << endl;
    }

    double area() override {
        return length * width;
    }
};

int main() {
    Shape* shapes[2];

    shapes[0] = new Circle(5.0);       // Circle with radius 5
    shapes[1] = new Rectangle(4.0, 6.0); // Rectangle with length 4 and width 6

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        shapes[i]->draw();
        cout << "Area: " << shapes[i]->area() << endl;
    }

    // Clean up
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        delete shapes[i];
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**:
```
Drawing Circle
Area: 78.5398
Drawing Rectangle
Area: 24
```

### **Explanation**

1. **Abstract Base Class**:
   - The `Shape` class has two pure virtual functions: `draw()` and `area()`.
   - It defines a contract that all shapes must implement these functions.

2. **Derived Classes**:
   - `Circle` and `Rectangle` provide concrete implementations of `draw()` and `area()`.

3. **Polymorphism**:
   - The `Shape*` pointer can point to any derived object (like `Circle` or `Rectangle`), and the correct overridden function is executed at runtime.

4. **Forcing Design Consistency**:
   - Every new shape derived from `Shape` must implement `draw()` and `area()`.

### **Industrial Use Case**

#### **Example: Device Drivers**

Imagine an interface for device drivers where every device must implement methods for initialization and communication.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Device {
public:
    virtual void initialize() = 0; // Pure virtual function
    virtual void communicate() = 0; // Pure virtual function
};

class USBDevice : public Device {
public:
    void initialize() override {
        cout << "USB Device Initialized" << endl;
    }

    void communicate() override {
        cout << "Communicating via USB" << endl;
    }
};

class BluetoothDevice : public Device {
public:
    void initialize() override {
        cout << "Bluetooth Device Initialized" << endl;
    }

    void communicate() override {
        cout << "Communicating via Bluetooth" << endl;
    }
};

int main() {
    Device* devices[2];

    devices[0] = new USBDevice();
    devices[1] = new BluetoothDevice();

    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        devices[i]->initialize();
        devices[i]->communicate();
    }

    // Clean up
    for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
        delete devices[i];
    }

    return 0;
}
```

#### **Output**:
```
USB Device Initialized
Communicating via USB
Bluetooth Device Initialized
Communicating via Bluetooth
```

### **Key Points**

1. **Cannot Instantiate Abstract Classes**:
   - You cannot create objects of `Device` or `Shape` because they are abstract.

2. **Forces Implementation**:
   - Any class inheriting `Device` must implement `initialize()` and `communicate()`.

3. **Flexible Design**:
   - The base class defines what methods must exist, while derived classes provide the specific implementations.

### **Common Questions**
#### **What Happens if a Derived Class Does Not Implement All Pure Virtual Functions?**
The derived class itself becomes an abstract class and cannot be instantiated.

#### **Can a Class Have Both Regular and Pure Virtual Functions?**
Yes, an abstract class can have a mix of:
- Regular functions with implementations.
- Pure virtual functions that must be implemented by derived classes.

#### **Can a Constructor or Destructor Be Pure Virtual?**
- **Constructor**: No, constructors cannot be virtual or pure virtual.
- **Destructor**: Yes, a destructor can be pure virtual, but it must have a body for cleanup purposes. This ensures polymorphic deletion of objects.
